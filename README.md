# JUICE - JaCoCo UnitTest and IntegrationTest Configuration Example
## Motivation 
Configuring Maven, Surefire, Failsafe and JaCoCo requires the skills of 
a lockpicker: there are only a very few combinations which work. 
 
This is offered in the hope it saves you, or future me, some time.
  
### Invoke  
```
mvn clean install site [-Dpublish]
```

!Note
The site is automatically deployed to http://timp.github.io/juice/
if the property publish is defined.
