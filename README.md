# JUICE - JaCoCo UnitTest and IntegrationTest Configuration Example
## Motivation 
Configuring Maven, Surefire, Failsafe and JaCoCo requires the skills of 
a lockpicker as there are only a very few combinations which work. 
 
This is offered in the hope it saves you, or future me, some time.
 
Sadly the versions of the components will have changed, 
and so have broken, by time I need this next :wink: .
  
### Invoke  
```
mvn clean install site site-deploy
```
